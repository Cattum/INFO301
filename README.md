## Theory – Critical Engagement with Visualization Methodologies

### Figure 1: Cooling Degree Days  
### Figure 2: Critique of Cooling Degree Days

#### Concise Explanation

This critique (Figure 2) of the cooling degree visualization (Figure 1) applies a structured method based on visual perception theory and data ethics. The process begins with identifying the infographic’s intent—to communicate global cooling energy demand under climate change scenarios. It then analyzes visual encoding strategies (color, layout, resolution), evaluates perceptual clarity, and assesses compliance with the FAIR data principles. The critique incorporates theoretical references from:

- Edward Tufte (1983)  
- Colin Ware (2021)  
- Wilkinson (2022)

Based on these evaluations, specific recommendations are made to enhance interpretability, accessibility, and data transparency.

## Research – Literature-Inspired Analysis

### Figure 3: Flowchart of *Perception! Immersion! Empowerment!* Superpowers as Inspiration for Visualization (2022)

The visualization flowchart in Figure 3 systematically explores the research process, illustrating how fictional superpowers can be integrated into data visualization.

The study follows:
- Card et al. (1999)
- Munzner (2014)

#### Central Idea

While traditional visualization emphasizes efficiency and accuracy, this study draws from sci-fi superpowers to augment perception and cognition for more immersive and intuitive data interaction.

It explores applications in:
- AR/VR interfaces  
- Assistive technologies  
- Predictive analytics  
- Immersive education  

#### Key Findings

- Seven superpower-inspired visualization models identified
- Enhanced data perception, interactivity, and predictive capabilities
- Bridges HCI, cognitive science, and visualization

#### Intellectual Contributions

1. Expands the theoretical foundation of visualization research  
2. Highlights the need for empirical validation across user groups

## Practice – Tool-Driven Redesign Preparation

### Figure 4: Workflow – Amazon QuickSight  
### Figure 5: Heatmap – Impact of Discounts and Quantity on Profit

#### Dataset Description

- Source: `SaaS-Sales.csv`  
- 9,994 transaction records  
- Variables:
  - **Discount (%)**
  - **Quantity**
  - **Profit ($)**

#### Key Insights

1. **High profit** when discounts are low and quantity is high  
2. **Significant losses** when high discounts meet low sales  
3. **Missing data** in rare discount-quantity combos

#### Business Use

- Find optimal discount levels  
- Avoid unprofitable discounts  
- Develop data-driven pricing models

#### Evaluation of Amazon QuickSight

**Pros:**
- No-code interactive visualization  
- AI assistant (Amazon Q)  
- Predictive modeling  
- Interactive elements (tooltip, filters)

**Cons:**
- No reference baseline (e.g., $0 in Profit)  
- Limited chart customizability  
- Lacks flexibility for advanced users

#### Recommendations

- Allow manual axis and color scale settings  
- Improve AI (Amazon Q) for custom tasks  
- Address interface limitations (per Gartner, 2023)

#### Redesign Strategy Summary

Using QuickSight, the redesign addressed:
- Perceptual clarity  
- Interactivity  
- Data transparency

Enhancements included:
- Dynamic filtering  
- Hover tooltips  
- Drill-down views  
- Diverging color scales  
- Contextual info (labels, metadata, licenses)

## Innovation – Final Redesign and Integration

### Title: **Enhancing Climate Risk Communication**

#### Inspiration & Theory

- **Tufte (1983)** – Data-to-ink ratio  
- **Ware (2021)** – Color and cognitive load  
- **FAIR Principles** – Transparency and reuse

#### Tools Used

- **Amazon QuickSight**

#### Key Improvements

- Red-yellow-blue gradient for clarity and accessibility  
- Dark mode for contrast  
- Source data visible  
- Hover function for region-specific insights  
- Metadata and license inclusion for FAIR compliance  

> Result: A more accessible, transparent, and interactive filledmap visualization.
